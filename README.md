Hey there, I'm Neoron G. Lopez! Currently a computer science student. 

Aiming to be a deeply data scientist. I would like to spent countless hours delving into coding languages like Python, honing my skills in algorithms and data structures, and exploring the vast realm of databases.

I also know how to center a div. :)
