                <h1 class="sub-title">About Me</h1>
                <p>I am currently a second year student at Map√∫a Malayan Colleges Laguna with the course
                of Computer Science, I need to succeed and in order to do that I must keep improving myself
                everyday and keep studying in order to not dissapoint my parents.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <p>First I must answer the question, why did I choose this career path, for me I saw
                            technology rapidly evolving and I become aware that in the future artificial intelligence
                            will be better than humans at doing their jobs therefore replacing us, so I would like to
                            prepared by not having a job that can be easily replaced by artificial intelligence. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The future of artificial intelligence can be close but since it has not been perfected yet,
                            the demand for computer science professionals is consistently high across industries, 
                            opening up numerous career opportunities afterall my priority in life is to retire early and 
                            enjoy the nature that sorround us, explore the world and have nothing to worry about. 
                        </p>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                    <div class="tab-contents" id="Goals">
                        <ul>
                            <p>My Goal is to become a Machine Learning Engineer, that is my priority job but if destiny
                                dosen't allign I will settle for a Cloud Architech since it gives the best salary but in 
                                order to achieve my priority job, I need to build a strong foundation in machine learning 
                                concepts, algorithms, and techniques. This includes understanding supervised and unsupervised 
                                learning, regression, classification, clustering, and various optimization methods.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Of course my primary objective is financial freedom and early retirement. Building a strong 
                                financial foundation is crucial for early retirement. I plan to adopt a disciplined approach 
                                to saving and investing, taking advantage of tax-efficient accounts and exploring diverse investment 
                                opportunities to maximize returns. In addition to my full-time job, I aim to explore side projects or 
                                entrepreneurial ventures that align with my skills and interests.
                            </p>

                                <p>I consider my hobby to be gaming since my interest could also lead to exploring game development. 
                                    Gaming involves intricate graphics and animations, which has sparked my curiosity in this aspect of 
                                    computer science. I may delve into learning graphics programming, understanding rendering techniques, 
                                    and exploring animation algorithms to enhance my understanding of the visual components of games. 
                                    As a computer science student, I might take the opportunity to learn about popular game engines like 
                                    Unity or Unreal Engine. 
                                </p>

                                    Also my notable hobbies that are not related to computer science is collecting hot wheels and transformers,
                                    sometime I could go for a bike ride or play badminton, if my parents have a long weekend we can go camping or
                                    hiking.
                                </p>
